Hello! Welcome to my academic website!
=====
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science in the Department of Political Science at The University of Iowa. My research areas are comparative politics and political methodology, focusing in particular on populism, political representation, and public notions of different democracy. Methodologically, I leverage advanced quantitative methods, especially multilevel modelling, computational text analysis and Machine Learning.

I am planning to defend my dissertation by May 2025. In my dissertation, I systematically theorize and examine the influence of political representation by exisitng political system on public support for populism.
