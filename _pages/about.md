I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at [The University of Iowa](https://politicalscience.uiowa.edu/), with plans to defend my dissertation in the spring of 2025. My research focuses on comparative politics, public opinion, and political behavior, particularly exploring populism, political representation, public support for democracy, and democratic backsliding. Methodologically, I utilize various quantitative methods, including multilevel modeling, computational text analysis, and machine learning. My research has been published or forthcoming in *Democratization* and *International Migration Review*.

With a focus on public support for populism as a response to discontent with contemporary democratic systems, my dissertation investigates how the level of political representation or issue-congruence between the public and political parties influences public support for populism in different regions. Additionally, I examine how individuals' perceptions of democracy - ranging from liberal democracy, guardianship/illiberal democracy to direct democracy - moderate their susceptibility to populist appeals, given that populism claims to restore "true" democracy. 

I have received various scholarships and fellowships in recognition of my academic achievements, including the Graduate College Summer Fellowship at the University of Iowa, the Scholarship for Political Science Research at ICPSR, and Scholarship for [The Swedish Interdisciplinary Research School in Computational Social Science](https://liu.se/en/research/research-school-in-computational-social-science) at The Institute for Analytical Sociology (IAS) in Sweden.

As a dedicated scholar, I serve on the Steering Committee of the [Young Scholars Initiative on Populism (OPUS)](https://populism.byu.edu/directory/jeongho-choi), a division within the international research network in populism studies, [Team Populism](https://populism.byu.edu/). I hold both an M.A. and a B.A. (Graduated with High Distinction) in Political Science from Kyung Hee University, South Korea.
