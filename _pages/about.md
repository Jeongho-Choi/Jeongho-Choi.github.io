I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science in the Department of Political Science at [The University of Iowa](https://politicalscience.uiowa.edu/). My research areas encompass comparative politics and political methodology, with a specific focus on populism, political representation, and public perceptions of different democratic systems. Methodologically, I employ several quantitative methods, particularly multilevel modeling, computational text analysis, and machine learning.

I am currently planning to defend my dissertation by May 2025. In my dissertation, I systematically theorize and examine the impact of political representation within existing political systems on public support for populism.

I hold both an M.A. and a B.A. in Political Science from Kyung Hee University, South Korea.
